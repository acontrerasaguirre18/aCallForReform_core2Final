        <div class="titleStyle" id="title1Pos"> Systemic Oppression </div>        
        <div class="phStyle" id="ph1Pos"> The New York City Police Department's policies, practices, and culture 
            perpetuate discrimination and bias against racial and ethnic minority communities, resulting in unequal 
            treatment and disproportionate impacts on these communities. Historically, the NYPD has 
            taken a hostile approach towards interacting with communities of color. The department has employed 
            discriminatory practices, including racial profiling, excessive use of force, and abuse of power, 
            that disproportionately affect Black, Hispanic, and other minority communities in NYC.

         <div class="titleStyle" id="title2Pos"> Racial <br>Profiling</div>
            <div class="phStyle" id="ph2Pos"> Racial profiling by police in NYC refers to the practice of law enforcement 
                officers targeting individuals for suspicion or scrutiny based on their perceived race or ethnicity, rather 
                than on their behavior or evidence of wrongdoing. Racial profiling can result in disproportionate targeting 
                of individuals from specific racial or ethnic groups for stops, searches, arrests, or other forms of police action. 
                There have been numerous reports and studies that suggest racial profiling is a pervasive issue in NYC, particularly 
                affecting communities of color. The (NYPD) has faced significant scrutiny and criticism for its practices related to racial profiling.

        <div class="titleStyle" id="title3Pos"> Disproportionate Arrests of POCs </div>
            <div class="phStyle" id="ph3Pos"> Individuals from Black and Hispanic communities are arrested and incarcerated at higher 
                rates compared to individuals from White and Asian communities, despite similar rates of criminal activity. 
                This pattern of disproportionate arrests is often attributed to systemic biases within the criminal justice 
                system, including racial profiling, discriminatory policing practices, and disparities in access to legal 
                representation and other resources.

            <div class="titleStyle" id="title4Pos"> Economic <br> Factors</div>
                <div class="phStyle" id="ph4Pos"> Racial economic inequalities in NYC disproportionately affect 
                    communities of color. These inequalities can manifest in various aspects of economic life, 
                    including income, employment, education, housing, and access to financial resources. One key 
                    area of racial economic inequality is income. Studies have shown that there are significant 
                    wage gaps between different racial and ethnic groups in the city. Black and Hispanic workers 
                    tend to earn lower wages compared to White and Asian workers, even when factors such as 
                    education and experience are considered. This can result in reduced economic mobility, 
                    increased poverty rates, and limited opportunities for wealth creation and financial security 
                    within communities of color.
